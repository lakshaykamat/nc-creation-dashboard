When writing code, aim for solutions that are minimal, readable, maintainable, and correct. Always prefer the simplest approach that works, avoiding unnecessary abstractions, layers, or clever tricks that make the code harder to understand. Use clear and consistent naming, keep functions and files small and focused, and only add comments when they provide valuable context. Organize code logically so that future changes are easy, and ensure correctness with tests when appropriate. Avoid over-engineering, premature optimization, dependency bloat, and hidden complexity that obscures logic. Good code should be concise (no redundancy), easy to read, easy to extend or refactor, and reliable in solving the problem it was written for. In short, the best code balances clarity, correctness, and maintainability while keeping complexity as low as possible.
